 If one believes that a theory similar to Newton\'s or Einstein\'s means , the
theory on ̬ never .
 Are the theories  of  Newton or Einstein is universal ? Any  theory must be
like Newton\'s or Einstein\'s ? Who tell you ?
  The nature is more complicated than any theories. The simply theories like 
Newton\'s or Einstein\'s can be successful is the two only exceptions. The 
universal theories studied today are more like Landau\'s. Thus, Landau affected
today\'s Science more deeply.
 The time of classical physics like Newton\'s or Einstein\'s is over. There is no
  theories like those any more. We must modify the high-school and collage  textbook in China.
