 If one believes that a theory similar to Newton\'s or Einstein\'s means , the
theories on ̬ never . However, the ûг
theories on ̬ maybe win 50 Nobel prizes in this century.
   
 Are the theories  of  Newton or Einstein is universal ? Any  theory must be
like Newton\'s or Einstein\'s ? Who tell you ?
  The nature is more complicated than any theories. Newton\'s or Einstein\'s theories are the two only exceptions that the simply theories can be successful. The universal theories studied today are more like Landau\'s. Thus, Landau affected today\'s Science more deeply. 
 The time of classical physics like Newton\'s or Einstein\'s is over. There is no
  theories like those any more. We must modify the high-school and collage  textbook in China.
